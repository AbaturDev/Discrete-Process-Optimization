# Discrete Process Optimization
Repository for university course from **Discrete Process Optimization**. On this course we foucse on solving classic algorithmic problems focused on discrete optimization, where the goal is to find an optimal solution.

## 1. RPQ - Task Scheduling
A single-machine scheduling problem. The objective is to minimize the total completion time (makespan), given the processing time of each task.

## 2. WiTi
Another problem of task scheduling with penalties for late completion. The goal is to minimize the total weighted tardiness (∑ wᵢ · Tᵢ), where each task has a due date (dᵢ) and weight (wᵢ).

## 3. TSP - Travelling Salesman Problem
A classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
